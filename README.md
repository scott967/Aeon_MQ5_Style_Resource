# Aeon_MQ5_Style_Resource
Aeon MQ5 Menu Styles for Kodi Isengard 17.0 +

A project to update the Kodi skin Aeon MQ5 for use in Kodi Krypton versions from 17.0.  
The intent is to provide all functionality of MQ5 on Gotham (ver 2.02) with extensions to incorporate
new Helix and Isengard capabilities.  In some cases improvements from MQ5 Gotham will be included. 
This Kodi resource add-on is a replacement for Aeon MQ5 "EXTRAPACK" which is no longer used
in the skin.
